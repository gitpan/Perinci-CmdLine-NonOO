NAME
    Perinci::CmdLine::NonOO - Non-OO interface for Perinci::CmdLine

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of Perinci::CmdLine::NonOO (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-CmdLine-NonOO), released on 2014-08-04.

SYNOPSIS
     use Perinci::CmdLine::NonOO qw(run_cmdline_app);
     run_cmdline_app(url => '/Foo/bar');

    which is equivalent to:

     use Perinci::CmdLine::Lite;
     my $cli = Perinci::CmdLine::Lite->new(url => '/Foo/bar');
     $cli->run;

DESCRIPTION
    Perinci::CmdLine (or its alternatives Perinci::CmdLine::Lite,
    Perinci::CmdLine::Any) is a command-line application framework. It
    "exports" your functions as a CLI application. However, Perinci::CmdLine
    itself has an OO interface, which can be seen as ironic. This module is
    an attempt to fix this.
